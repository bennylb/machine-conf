For now the initialisation of this configuration is manual.

To use first clone the repo:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git clone https://github.com/bennylb/machine-conf.git
#+END_SRC

Then as root link configuration.nix:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cd "$HOME"/machine-conf
./link-configuration.sh
#+END_SRC

Install the system and then as a regular user run:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cd "$HOME"/machine-conf
